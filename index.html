            <p>Use of meta refresh is discouraged by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). <br>Ref: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh. So it is reccomended to use server redirect instead. JavaScript redirects may not work on all the mobile phones as JavaScript might be disabled. –

                FYI, the 0 means to refresh after 0 seconds. You may want to give the user some more time to know what's happening. –

                @Paul Draper, that depends on the server you're running –

                I added the tag closure to respect the XHTML5 specifications. –

                @NinethSense's comment makes meta refresh seem like a JavaScript redirect. Meta refresh is not JS and will still work when JS is disabled. –
